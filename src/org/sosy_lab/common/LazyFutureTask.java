/**
 * Future implementation that can be used when a task should be executed only lazily at the first
 * time {@link #get()} is called. I.e., it is not guaranteed that the task is run at all, but it is
 * called at most once.
 *
 * <p>Execution of the task happens in the caller's thread, a little bit similar to the use of
 * {@link com.google.common.util.concurrent.MoreExecutors#sameThreadExecutor()}, however, it is
 * executed on the thread calling {@link #get()} and not on the thread calling {@link
 * java.util.concurrent.ExecutorService#submit(Runnable)}.
 *
 * <p>Important: Calling {@link #get(long, TimeUnit)} is not supported and will always throw {@link
 * UnsupportedOperationException}.
 *
 * <p>Canceling this future works as expected.
