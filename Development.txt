Style Guide
-----------
The style guide of this project is the Google Java Style:
https://google.github.io/styleguide/javaguide.html

IMPORTANT: We use an automatic code formatter to format all our code.
Before committing, run "ant format-diff" to reformat your changes
according to the style guide.
For git users: You need to stage your changes first (with "git add"),
then run "ant format-diff" and then stage the changes again.
This allows you to view exactly what the reformatter changed after running it.

Please report your experiences with this, we would like to learn how well this works!
Git users: We are interested in experimenting with a pre-commit hook
for the code formatter. If you have one, please share it.


Before Committing
-----------------
Please run "ant tests findbugs checkstyle" and check and clear any reported problems.


Mailing List for Notifications
------------------------------
There is a mailing list with notifications for commits and TravisCI builds:
https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/common-java-dev
It is recommended to subscribe to this list to get notified of failing builds.

You can also use this list for discussion among developers,
or use the GitHub issue tracker.


Note for Eclipse Users
----------------------
This project uses Google AutoValue (https://github.com/google/auto/tree/master/value).
Eclipse does not pick up its annotation processor automatically.
You need to copy the file ".factorypath.template" to ".factorypath"
and adjust the path inside if your Eclipse project is not named "SoSy-Lab Common".

We recommend to install the Eclipse Checkstyle plugin (http://eclipse-cs.sourceforge.net/)
and the plugin with additional Checkstyle checks (https://github.com/sevntu-checkstyle/sevntu.checkstyle)
to be able to see the Checkstyle warnings in Eclipse
(the necessary configuration is included in the repository).
