Style Guide
-----------
The style guide of this project is the Google Java Style:
https://google.github.io/styleguide/javaguide.html

IMPORTANT: We use an automatic code formatter to format all our code.
Before committing, run "ant format-diff" to reformat your changes
according to the style guide.
For git users: You need to stage your changes first (with "git add"),
then run "ant format-diff" and then stage the changes again.
This allows you to view exactly what the reformatter changed after running it.

Please report your experiences with this, we would like to learn how well this works!
Git users: We are interested in experimenting with a pre-commit hook
for the code formatter. If you have one, please share it.


Before Committing
